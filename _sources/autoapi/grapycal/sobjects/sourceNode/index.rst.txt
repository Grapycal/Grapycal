.. py:class:: SourceNode


   Bases: :py:obj:`grapycal.sobjects.node.Node`

   Inherit from this class to conveniently create a node that can be a source of the graph (can be activated by the user.)
   This type of node can be activated by double clicking the node or by sending a signal the run port on the node.

   .. py:method:: build_node()

      Create attributes, ports, and controls here.

      Note: 
          This method will not be called when the object is being restored. The child objects will be restored automatically instead of
      running this method again.


   .. py:method:: init_node()

      This method is called after the node is built and its ports and controls are created. Use this method if you want to do something after
      the node is built.


   .. py:method:: task()

      Define the task of this node here. 
      By default, this method will be called when double clicking the node or when the run port on the node
        is activated (if there is one).


   .. py:method:: double_click()

      Called when the node is double clicked by an user.


   .. py:method:: on_activate(edge: grapycal.sobjects.edge.Edge, port: grapycal.sobjects.port.InputPort)
