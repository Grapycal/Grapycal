Nodes
===============

A node is a basic unit of a program. Each type of node performs a specific function, such as addition, getting or setting a variable, or reading a file.
Nodes can be connected together to form a graph that performs a more complex function.

A node consists of ports and controls. Ports serve as interfaces to other nodes, and controls serve as interfaces to the user.
