Basic Usage
=============

In Grapycal's UI layout, there are 3 main parts: the function tabs (node list by default), the graph editor and the inspector.

The node list contains all the nodes to use. To create a node, you can either:

1. drag them into the editor.
2. type the nodes' names directly and select the one you want from the auto-complete list.

Construct a Graph
-------------------

Let's create a simple graph that prints "Hello World!".

1. Drag an ``EvalNode`` and ``PrintNode`` into the editor and connect them together. 
2. Enter ``"Hello World!"`` into the ``EvalNode``'s text field.
3. Double click on the ``EvalNode`` to make it evaluate the expression. You should see "Hello World!" displayed in the ``PrintNode``.

You can make the graph as complex as you want. Note that even the expression has been edited, an ``EvalNode`` will not evaluate it until being double clicked.
