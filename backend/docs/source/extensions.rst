Extensions
================

Extensions provides definitions of nodes that can be used in a Grapycal workspace. The extension `builtin_nodes` is automatically included in 
every workspace, providing a set of basic nodes. You can create your own extensions to define custom nodes.


An extension is written as a python package with its name start with `grapycal_`.
