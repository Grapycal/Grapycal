Contribution
================================
Grapycal is still in its early stage. Any contribution is welcome! Currently, most of our efforts are on the backend (the core of Grapycal) and extensions (nodes with various functionalities), but it's also helpful to improve the frontend and the documentation.

To contribute:
-----------------

1. Please `install Grapycal from source <../getting_started/installation.html#install-from-source>`_ .

2. Play around with Grapycal and feel how Grapycal helps you as a user. Find out what you like and what you don't like. If you feel something is missing, you can add it and create a `pull request <https://github.com/Grapycal/Grapycal/pulls>`_ or `open an issue <https://github.com/Grapycal/Grapycal/issues>`_.

3. Refer to the :doc:`project_overview` to understand the project structure.

4. If you don't know where to start, visit the `Discussion:Plans <https://github.com/eri24816/Grapycal/discussions/categories/plans>`_ forum. Find a topic that interests you and assign yourself to it. If you have a new idea, you can also create a new topic.
