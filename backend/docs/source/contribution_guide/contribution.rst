Contribution
================================
Grapycal is still in its early stage. Any contribution is welcome! Currently, most of our efforts are on the backend (the core of Grapycal) and extensions (nodes with various functionalities), but it's also helpful to improve the frontend and the documentation.

To contribute, please `install Grapycal from source <https://eri24816.github.io/Grapycal/getting_started/installation.html#install-from-source>`_ and refer to the :doc:`project_overview` to get started. The `Discussion:Plans <https://github.com/eri24816/Grapycal/discussions/categories/plans>`_ forum contains the current plans for Grapycal and is a good place to start.

To discuss, feel free to go to `Discussion <https://github.com/eri24816/Grapycal/discussions>`_ or join the `Discord server <https://discord.gg/adNQcS42CT>`_.
