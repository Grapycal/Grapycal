   In our daily lives, countless ideas emerge in our minds, only to be dismissed because the perceived cost of realizing them is too high. Over time, sadly, we tend to forget our inherent creativity.

   The mission of Grapycal is to push more ideas over the line to be worthy of trying out.

.. This is a caption separating guide and API
   Nothing is inside this because AutoAPI will be inserted into TOC automatically
   The generated API docs will appeared to have a caption "API"
   This is a bit tricky but I think it looks good
